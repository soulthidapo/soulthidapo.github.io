## Project A: AI-Powered Mobility Service App Development (KINTO)
Focus: Mobile Engineering & AI Integration

**Overview
Led the development and maintenance of the Android application for KINTO, the Toyota Group’s vehicle subscription service. Specifically focused on integrating AI-driven personalization features to enhance the user experience.

**The Problem
To increase user engagement, the application needed to move away from a "one-size-fits-all" interface and toward a tailored experience that provides content recommendations based on individual user behavior and preferences.

**My Role & Responsibilities
Architecture Design: Engineered a modern, scalable Android architecture using MVVM, Hilt (Dependency Injection), and Jetpack Compose for a declarative UI.

AI Integration: Implemented on-device intelligence using Google AI/ML Kit, enabling features such as image recognition, text recognition (OCR), and real-time translation within the app.

Data Management: Developed efficient data fetching and caching layers using Apollo GraphQL to optimize network performance and responsiveness.

**Results
Enhanced Personalization: Successfully deployed a feature that classifies vehicle types and recommends relevant content based on user-uploaded photos, significantly boosting personalization.

Cross-functional Collaboration: Partnered closely with Backend, Product, and Design teams to ensure seamless integration and stable operation in the production environment.

**Key Technical Keywords Used
Android: Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Hilt, Kotlin.

AI/ML: Google ML Kit, Image/Text Recognition.

API/Data: Apollo GraphQL, Data Caching.
