[FoodHub!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bc3AIDT-jgql4AE9ZFDAF8z3mo8eSgvJ/view?usp=drive_link)
Course: Python Foundations

**Project description:** 
Perform an exploratory data analysis and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to get a fair idea about the demand for different restaurants and cuisines, which will help them enhance their customer experience and improve the business.

Skills & Tools Covered : python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Univariate AnalysisIvariate Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Business recommendations, Bivariate Analysis!

[Personal Loan Campaign!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmviQZuo2I2uvz-pXR4Zc3XXe6iFyxKz/view?usp=drive_link)

Course: Machine Learning

**Project description:** 
To identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan, you need to analyze the provided data to understand key customer attributes influencing loan acquisition. With this analysis, build a predictive model that captures patterns and customer characteristics, which will help the bank effectively target potential loan buyers, improving marketing efforts and increasing conversion rates.

Skills & Tools Covered: EDA, Data pre-processing, Model building - Decision Tree, Model Performance Evaluation and Improvement, Business Recommendations


[Credit Card Users Churn Prediction!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fV2y3Npyvl5XcSPqmgKtwL5OIn0aqU3d/view?usp=sharing)

Course: Advanced Machine Learning

**Project description:** 
To determine if a bank has seen a significant decline in credit card usage, analyze the provided data to understand how profitable credit cards are due to various fees. Build a predictive model that identifies patterns and customer characteristics to help the bank ensure appropriate fee structures.

Skills & Tools Covered: EDA, Data pre-processing, Model building - Bagging and Random Forest,  Boosting, Model Turnning, Model Performance Evaluation and Improvement, Business Recommendations

[Bank Churn Prediction!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4WH9sKAQ1hYBjhVKO9rUywyS1NT_lkG/view?usp=drive_link)

Course: Introduction to Neural Networks

**Project description:** 
Given a Bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.

Skills & Tools Covered: EDA, Data pre-processing, Model building, Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST Dataset, Loss Functions, Tensorflow, Keras, Artificial Neural Networks, Regularization

[Plants Seedling Classification!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12X2WLqtQpnCqCS9WZIXiEH06aKxZr-iS/view?usp=sharing)

Course: Introduction to Computer Vision

**Project description:** 
Build a robust image classifier using CNNs to efficiently classify different plant seedlings and weeds to improve crop yields and minimize human involvement.

Skills & Tools Covered: Image Processing, Keras, Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Networks


[Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u08pRKsrdMPsXYkrFPp4hiUs769HZDOd/view?usp=sharing)
Course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

**Project description:** 
Various factors, including company performance, innovations, and market sentiment, influence stock prices on global exchanges. News and opinions significantly impact these prices, but the sheer volume of information makes it difficult for investors to stay informed and interpret their impact accurately. Therefore, investment firms require sophisticated tools to analyze market sentiment and guide investment decisions.

Skills & Tools Covered: Word Embeddings, GloVe, Sentence Transformer, Sentiment Analysis

[Audio MNIST Digit Recognition!]

Course: Introduction to Neural Networks

**Project description:** 
The objective here is to build an Artificial Neural Network that can look at Mel or MFCC spectrograms of audio files and classify them into 10 classes. The audio files are recordings of different speakers uttering a particular digit and the corresponding class to be predicted is the digit itself.

Skills & Tools Covered: EDA, Data pre-processing, Model building , Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST Dataset, Lost Functions, Libraries: Librosa for Audio Preprocessing, Tensorflow, Keras, Artificial Neural Networks, Regularization
