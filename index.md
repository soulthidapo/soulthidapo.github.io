Course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

**Project description:** 
Various factors, including company performance, innovations, and market sentiment, influence stock prices on global exchanges. News and opinions significantly impact these prices, but the sheer volume of information makes it difficult for investors to stay informed and interpret their impact accurately. Therefore, investment firms require sophisticated tools to analyze market sentiment and guide investment decisions.

Skills & Tools Covered: Word Embeddings, GloVe, Sentence Transformer, Sentiment Analysis
