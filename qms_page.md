## Queue management system 

**Project description:** 

Queue management system supports both central server and distributed master-slave server architectures. All of its elements are web-based, therefore it can be used with PC, tablet, smart phone, etc. QMS offers plenty of optional software modules: statistics and monitoring, appointment, alert, visualization, voice recording, etc.

I worked QMS project with Angular2, HTML, CSS, and Java using GWT  Framework and SVN repository. I worked on the apache tomcat server using IDE as eclipse JAVA EE. We used [Project Life Cycle] Planning and APM(Agile project methodology) for project management. We support several databases and operating systems, the system can be upgraded in a very easy way, it is easy to integrate with 3rd party software.
