**Project description:** Electronic Medical Record System 

I worked primarily with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java using GWT  Framework and SVN repository. I worked on the apache tomcat server using IDE as eclipse JAVA EE. We used [Project Life Cycle] Planning and APM(Agile project methodology) for project management. We always customize for both new clients requirements and old clients additional requirements, there is continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle planning, executing and controlling are usually repeated several times.
